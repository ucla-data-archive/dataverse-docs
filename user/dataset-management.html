<h1>Dataset + File Management<a class="headerlink" href="#dataset-file-management" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>A dataset in Dataverse is a container for your data, documentation, code, and other products of research in addition to metadata describing this &#8220;dataset&#8221;.</p>
<p><img alt="image1" src="../_images/DatasetDiagramV2.png" /></p>
<div class="section" id="supported-metadata">
<h2>Supported Metadata<a class="headerlink" href="#supported-metadata" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>A dataset contains three levels of metadata:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><strong>Citation Metadata</strong>: any metadata that would be needed for generating a data citation and other general metadata that could be applied to any dataset;</li>
<li><strong>Domain specific Metadata</strong>: with specific support currently for Social Science, Life Science, Geospatial, and Astronomy datasets; and</li>
<li><strong>File-level Metadata</strong>: varies depending on the type of data file - see <em>File Handling and Uploading</em> section below for more details).</li>
</ol>
<p>For more details about what Citation and Domain specific metadata is supported please see our <a class="reference external" href="../user/appendix.html#metadata-references">Appendix</a>.</p>
<p>Note that once a dataset has been published its metadata may be exported. A button on the dataset page’s metadata tab will allow a user to export the metadata of the most recently published version of the dataset. Currently supported export formats are DDI, Dublin Core and JSON.</p>

<p><strong>Please contact libra&#64;virginia.edu if you need to upload a file that is larger than 6GB.</strong></p>
<p>The file types listed below are supported by additional functionality, which can include downloading in different formats, subsets, file-level metadata preservation, file-level data citation; and exploration through data visualization and analysis.</p>
<div class="section" id="tabular-data-files">
<h3>Tabular Data Files<a class="headerlink" href="#tabular-data-files" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Files in certain formats - Stata, SPSS, R, Excel(xlsx) and CSV - may
be ingested as tabular data (see &#8220;Tabular Data Ingest&#8221; section for
details).</p>
<p>COMING SOON:
Tabular data files can be further explored and manipulated
with <a class="reference external" href="../user/data-exploration/tworavens.html">TwoRavens</a> - a
statistical data exploration application integrated with Dataverse. It
allows the user to run statistical models, view summary statistics,
download subsets of variable vectors and more. To start, click on the &#8220;Explore&#8221;
button, found next to each relevant tabular file (the application
will be opened in a new window). To download subsets of variables
click on the &#8220;Download&#8221; button found next to a relevant tabular file
and select &#8220;Data Subset&#8221; in the dropdown menu. You will then be able
to create your subset using the interface opened in a new window (this
functionality is also provided by the <a class="reference external" href="../user/data-exploration/tworavens.html">TwoRavens</a> project). See the <a class="reference external" href="../user/data-exploration/tworavens.html">TwoRavens
documentation section</a> for
more information.</p>
<p>To use the ingest functionality for tabular files, a file can only be up to 2GB in size, however, to upload a tabular file without using ingest, a file can be up to 6GB in size.</p>
<p><strong>For files larger that 6GB, please contact libra&#64;virginia.edu for upload assistance.</strong></p>
<p>To use the ingest functionality for RData files, a file can only be up to 1MB in size, however, to upload a RData file without using ingest, a file can be up to 2GB in size.</p>
<p>Additional download options available for tabular data (found
in the same drop-down menu under the &#8220;Download&#8221; button):</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>As tab-delimited data (with the variable names in the first row);</li>
<li>The original file uploaded by the user;</li>
<li>Saved as R data (if the original file was not in R format);</li>
<li>Variable Metadata (as a <a class="reference external" href="http://www.ddialliance.org/Specification/DDI-Codebook/">DDI Codebook</a> XML file);</li>

<h3>Geospatial<a class="headerlink" href="#geospatial" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Geospatial <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapefile">shapefiles</a> can be further explored and manipulated through our integration
with <a class="reference external" href="../user/data-exploration/worldmap.html">WorldMap</a>, a geospatial data visualization
and analysis tool developed by the <a class="reference external" href="http://gis.harvard.edu/">Center for Geographic Analysis</a> at Harvard University. A shapefile is a set of files, often uploaded/transferred in .zip format.  This set may contain up to 15 files.  A minimum of 3 specific files (.shp, .shx, .dbf) are needed to be a valid shapefile and a 4th file (.prj) is required for WorldMap&#8211;or any type of meaningful visualization.</p>
<p>For ingest into Dataverse and connecting to WorldMap, these 4 files are the minimum required:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>.shp - shape format; the feature geometry itself</li>
<li>.shx - shape index format; a positional index of the feature geometry to allow seeking forwards and backwards quickly</li>
<li>.dbf - attribute format; columnar attributes for each shape, in dBase IV format</li>
<li>.prj - projection format; the coordinate system and projection information, a plain text file describing the projection using well-known text format</li>
</ul>
<p>For a zipped shapefile, we require 4 files with these extensions. Other files may be included within the zipped shapefile, but they are not required:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>.shp</li>
<li>.shx</li>
<li>.prj</li>
<li>.dbf</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, if these files were included within a .zip, the “Map Data” button would appear:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>subway_line.shp</li>
<li>subway_line.shx</li>
<li>subway_line.prj</li>
<li>subway_line.dbf</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you publish your dataset with your shape files, you will be able to use the &#8220;Map Data&#8221; button using <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/IQSS/geoconnect">GeoConnect</a> to visualize and manipulate these files
for users to Explore this geospatial data using the <a class="reference external" href="http://worldmap.harvard.edu/">WorldMap</a> interface.
Please note: In order to map your data file, a copy will be sent to Harvard&#8217;s <a class="reference external" href="http://worldmap.harvard.edu/">WorldMap</a> platform. You have the ability to delete any maps, and associated data, from the Harvard WorldMap platform, at any time.</p>

<h2>Replace Files<a class="headerlink" href="#replace-files" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In cases where you would like to revise an existing file rather than add a new one, you can do so using our Replace File feature. This will allow you to track the history of this file across versions of your dataset, both before and after replacing it. This could be useful for updating your data or fixing mistakes in your data.</p>
<p>Go to the file page for the file you would like to replace, click on the “Edit” button, and from the dropdown list select “Replace”. This will bring you to the Replace File page, where you can see the metadata for the most recently published version of the file and you can upload your replacement file. Once you have uploaded the replacement file, you can edit its name, description, and tags. When you’re finished, click the “Save Changes” button.</p>
<p>After successfully replacing a file, a new dataset draft version will be created. A summary of your actions will be recorded in the dataset Version Details table in the “Versions” tab on that dataset’s page, and in the file Version Details table on the file’s page. Both tables allow you to access all previous versions of the file across all previous versions of your dataset, including the old version of the file before you replaced it.</p>

<p>If you would like to manually select your dataset’s thumbnail, you can do so by clicking the “Edit” button on your dataset, and selecting “Thumbnails + Widgets” from the dropdown menu.</p>
<p>On this page, under the Thumbnail tab you will see three possible actions.</p>
<p><strong>Select Available File:</strong> Click the “Select Thumbnail” button to choose an image from your dataset to use as the dataset thumbnail.</p>
<p><strong>Upload New File:</strong> Upload an image file from your computer to use as the dataset thumbnail. While by default your thumbnail image is drawn from a file in your dataset, this will allow you to upload a separate image file to use as your dataset thumbnail. This uploaded image file will only be used as the dataset thumbnail; it will not be stored as a data file in your dataset.</p>

<h3>Widgets<a class="headerlink" href="#id6" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The Widgets feature provides you with code for your personal website so your dataset can be displayed. There are two types of Widgets for a dataset: the Dataset Widget and the Dataset Citation Widget. The Widgets are found by going to your dataset page, clicking the Edit button (the one with the pencil icon) and selecting Widgets from the dropdown menu.</p>
<p>In the Widgets tab, you can copy and paste the code snippets for the widget you would like to add to your website. If you need to adjust the height of the widget on your website, you may do so by editing the <cite>heightPx=500</cite> parameter in the code snippet.</p>
<div class="section" id="dataset-widget">
<h4>Dataset Widget<a class="headerlink" href="#dataset-widget" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>The Dataset Widget allows the citation, metadata, files and terms of your dataset to be displayed on your website. When someone downloads a data file in the widget, it will download directly from the datasets on your website. If a file is restricted, they will be directed to your dataverse to log in, instead of logging in through the widget on your site.</p>
<p>To edit your dataset, you will need to return to the Dataverse repository where the dataset is stored. You can easily do this by clicking on the link that says &#8220;Data Stored in (Name) Dataverse&#8221; found in the bottom of the widget.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="dataset-citation-widget">
<h4>Dataset Citation Widget<a class="headerlink" href="#dataset-citation-widget" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>The Dataset Citation Widget will provide a citation for your dataset on your personal or project website. Users can download the citation in various formats by using the Cite Data button. The persistent URL in the citation will direct users to the dataset in your dataverse.</p>

<h2>Publish Dataset<a class="headerlink" href="#publish-dataset" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>When you publish a dataset (available to an Admin, Curator, or any custom role which has this level of permission assigned), you make it available to the public so that other users can browse or search for it. Once your dataset is ready to go public, go to your dataset page and click on the &#8220;Publish&#8221; button on the right hand side of the page. A pop-up will appear (see below)  to confirm that you are ready to actually Publish since <strong>once a dataset is made public it can no longer be unpublished or deleted</strong>.</p>

<h2>Dataset Versioning [Not Recommended at UVA]<a class="headerlink" href="#dataset-versioning-not-recommended-at-uva" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Versioning is important for long term-research data management where metadata and/or files are updated over time. It is used to track any metadata or file changes (e.g., by uploading a new file, changing file metadata, adding or editing metadata) once you have published your dataset.</p>
<p><img alt="image3" src="../_images/version_workflow.png" /></p>
<p>Once you edit your published dataset a new draft version of this dataset will be created. To publish this new version of your dataset, select the “Publish Dataset” button on the top right side of the page. If you were at version 1 of your dataset, depending on the types of changes you had made, you would be asked to publish your draft as either version 1.1 or version 2.0.</p>
<p><strong>Important Note:</strong> If you add a file, your dataset will automatically be bumped up to a major version (e.g., if you were at 1.0 you will go to 2.0).</p>
<p>On the Versions tab of a dataset page, there is a versions table that displays the version history of the dataset. You can use the version number links in this table to navigate between the different versions of the dataset, including the unpublished draft version, if you have permission to access it.</p>
<p>There is also a Versions tab on the file page. The versions table for a file displays the same information as the dataset, but the summaries are filtered down to only show the actions related to that file. If a new dataset version were created without any changes to an individual file, that file’s version summary for that dataset version would read “No changes associated with this version”.</p>
<div class="section" id="version-details">
<h3>Version Details<a class="headerlink" href="#version-details" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>To view what has exactly changed starting from the originally published version to any subsequent published versions: click the Versions tab on the dataset page to see all versions and changes made for that particular dataset.</p>
<p>Once you have more than one version (can be version 1 and a draft), you can click the “View Details” link next to each summary to learn more about the metadata fields and files that were either added or edited. You can also click the checkboxes to select any two dataset versions, then click the “View Differences” button to open the Version Differences Details popup and compare the differences between them.</p>

<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="first admonition-title">Warning</p>
<p class="last">It is not recommended that you deaccession a dataset or a version of a dataset. This is a very serious action that should only occur if there is a legal or valid reason for the dataset to no longer be accessible to the public. If you absolutely must deaccession, you can deaccession a version of a dataset or an entire dataset.</p>
</div>
<p>To deaccession, go to your published dataset (or add a new one and publish it), click the “Edit” button, and from the dropdown menu select “Deaccession Dataset”. If you have multiple versions of a dataset, you can select here which versions you want to deaccession or choose to deaccession the entire dataset.</p>
<p>You must also include a reason as to why this dataset was deaccessioned. Select the most appropriate reason from the dropdown list of options. If you select “Other”, you must also provide additional information.</p>
<p>Add more information as to why this was deaccessioned in the free-text box. If the dataset has moved to a different repository or site you are encouraged to include a URL (preferably persistent) for users to continue to be able to access this dataset in the future.</p>
<p>If you deaccession the most recently published version of the dataset but not all versions of the dataset, you are able to go in and create a new draft for the dataset. For example, you have a version 1 and version 2 of a dataset, both published, and deaccession version 2. You are then able to edit version 1 of the dataset and a new draft will be created.</p>
<p><strong>Important Note</strong>: A tombstone landing page with the basic citation metadata will always be accessible to the public if they use the persistent URL (Handle or DOI) provided in the citation for that dataset.  Users will not be able to see any of the files or additional metadata that were previously available prior to deaccession.</p>
