My Data
========================
The My Data section of your account page displays a listing of all the datasets, and files you have either created, uploaded or that you have access to edit. You are able to filter through all the datasets, and files listed there using the filter box or use the facets on the left side to only view a specific Publication Status or Role.  

Notifications: Setup & Maintenance
===================================
Notifications appear in the notifications tab on your account page and are also displayed as a number next to your account name.

You will receive a notification when:

- You've created your account
- You've added a dataset
- Another Dataverse user has requested access to a restricted file in one of your datasets

Libra Data will email your unread notifications once a day. Notifications will only be emailed one time even if you haven't read the notification on the Dataverse site.

Generate Your API Token
========================
#. To generate your API token, click on your name in the header on right hand side and then click on "Account Information".
#. On the top right of your account page, click on the "Account Information" button and click on "API Token" in the list.
#. Your API Token is located on that page.
